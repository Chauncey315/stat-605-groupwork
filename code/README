our github is: https://github.com/Enya0128/stat-605-groupwork

Run our job: ./submit.sh (submit.dag)

Remarks of Data: Our data is refreshed daily. When we run our code for different day, it may need different memory and disk, and get different results, because our data becomes larger and larger. And sometimes, it may get in trouble. For example, one day's refreshed data has some problems of overlap, so previous code may cause wrong results. I have done my best to solve it, but I don't know what future problems will be shown. If the future refreshed data just has this problem, our code can get real-time results.

The code contains three parts of our work.
1. find average quality of each production(movie,short,tvShort,...) for each year, and Top 5 productions in each year
pre1.sh
group1.sub (group1.R, group1.sh)
post1.sh

The output we need are:
1) averge rating and voting of each production in each year
Year/* (folder Year contains 10 files)
2) Top 5 productions in each year
TopProduction/* (This folder contains 835 files, and they are too much, so we just reserve movie2010.txt - movie2019.txt, short2010.txt - short2019.txt)


2. find highest-rated production
pre2.sh
group2.sub (group2.R, group2.sh)
merge_best.sh

The output we need is:
best.csv

 
3. find the most prolific movie people.

This part contains following files:
Prework.sh
workpeople.sub (merge.R, getResult.R, work.txt, merge.sh)
Postwork.sh

The outputs we need are:
1) Top 10 movie people and their average rating:
TopPeople/Actor10.txt, Actress10.txt, Composer10.txt, Director10.txt, Producer10.txt
2) Top 3 movie people and their movies (and average rating for each movie):
TopPeople/rateactor.txt, rateactress.txt, ratecomposer.txt, ratedirector.txt, rateproducer.txt
