## Introduction
The goal of the project is to get insights in the [IMDb data](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/). We mainly focus on three questions:  
1. What is the trend of ratings and audience interest over time?  
2. Is there any difference in audience interest among different kinds of productions?   
3. The best production and movie people in the eyes of audience?   

To answer these questions, we paralleize our computation in 850 jobs on the CHTC platform, plot related graphs and make a conclusion under statistical results. In general, we find that there is no signficant changes on ratings and audience interest from 1840 to 2019. For the difference among different kinds of production, apart from that movie is always dominated among the audience, specially some modern entertainment and production, like video games and TV series, become more and more fashionable, and they have called more audience attention and higher ratings in recent 30 years. Specifically, we list top10 movie people by role and top5 productions by category.
